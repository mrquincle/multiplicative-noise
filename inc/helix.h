/**
 * Specific data structure very convenient for 1-dimensional integration:
 * 1.) No copying around from left <- center <- right but using two arrays
 * 2.) Very fast circular implementation by updating boundary values only in update()
 * 3.) Very fast left() and right() implementation by dedicated shifted array indices.

 * 1.) There are two arrays instead of one (memory footprint is *2). Integration is
 * over old values. Instead of some "sliding window" we just calculate the new value
 * given some neighbours (left and right) and put it in another array. When all values
 * are calculated, the user is responsible for calling "update()" which internally
 * swaps the source and target arrays.
 * 2.) To make it a circular array, no linked list construction is created (with get()
 * overhead), but an array that is two elements larger than the original. The first and
 * last values are copied on update(), so left and right make also sense for first and
 * last item.
 * 3.) There is a "me_right" array that is shifted to the right, so index "i" points
 * directly to the item at the right (without incrementing anything). Likewise with
 * "me_raw" for the item at the left.
